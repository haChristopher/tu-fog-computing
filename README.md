# Fog Computing Project ðŸš€ | Summer Term 2023 TU Berlin
We are pleased to present our project, developed as part of the "Fog Computing" course at TU Berlin. In this endeavor, we focused on the development of an application for weather data collection using simulated sensors. Our main objective was to apply the concepts of Fog Computing to efficiently and reliably gather and process weather data.
For our simulation, we modeled three weather stations located in the cities of Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich. Each station continuously collects data on various meteorological parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed. These data are of crucial importance for various applications, including weather forecasting, agriculture, and construction planning.
To efficiently capture and process the data, we opted for the Fog Computing approach. This involves leveraging a decentralized network of fog i.e. edge devices to perform data processing and storage closer to the data sources. This enables faster response to events, reduces data traffic to the central data center, and provides increased control over data privacy. Our application utilizes this Fog Computing architecture by capturing data from the simulated weather stations and transmitting it in real-time to the Fog devices. 
This README.md file will provide detailed insights into the architecture of our application, the implementation of the simulated sensors, and the algorithms employed for data processing.

# Data generation
We used sensors to collect the weather data. We had two options for sourcing the data: (i) simulating the environmental data within a specific range or (ii) parsing live data from the weather API provided by www.weatherapi.com.

# Docker Compose for running Locally

All 3 components can be run locally using docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```

After changes you need to rebuild
```
docker-compose build
```

Running a single service:

```
docker-compose up cloud-server
```
